            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>It is important to use descriptive file names so that a user will know what is in them before opening them.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Paint 3D to change the size of the image.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was 2121x1414.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io to compress the file. The original size of the file was 16 kilobytes, while the compressed one was 7 kilobytes.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The compressed image is of lower quality that the original image is.</p>
